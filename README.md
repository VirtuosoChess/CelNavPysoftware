# CelNavPysoftware
Basic celestial navigation software that plots Lines of Position (LOPs) on a 3D Earth's globe.

# What it does?
1.Calculate the celestial body's position (GHA, Dec) at a given time.

2.Compute the altitude and azimuth from an assumed position.

3.Calculate the intercept and azimuth for position fixing.

4.Visualize the LOPs and the assumed/fixed positions on a 3D globe.

# Library
'numpy' for numerical computations.

'datetime' for handling date and time.

'matplotlib' for plotting.

'mpl_toolkits.basemap' for 3D globe visualization.

# Warning
This script provides a basic celestial navigation software with visualization on a 3D globe. For real-world applications, you'd need to refine the astronomical calculations and handle multiple celestial bodies!
